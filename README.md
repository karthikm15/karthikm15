### Hi there, I'm Karthik Mittal 👋 

I'm an emerging innovator with a mission to disrupt the biomedical industry using cloud, AI, and ML technologies and build products and services through my company, Neuralyte. My goal is to influence social change and develop accessible solutions to pressing issues the world faces using emerging technologies.

🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  - Using ML 🤖 to detect genetic factors that can relate to leukemic stem cell proliferation
  - Understanding global and local sequence alignment through the BLAST and Needleman-Wunsch algorithm 💻
  - Finding sets of similar genes 🧬 between anatomically close cancers through clustering algorithms

📝 Some of my past projects ...
  - 🧫 Identification of Biological Pathways Causative for Breast Cancer Through Unsupervised Machine Learning - [paper](https://horizonreport23.s3.amazonaws.com/report.html), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbZjcXZJOA4&t=3s)
