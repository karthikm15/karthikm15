### Hi there, I'm Karthik Mittal 👋 

I'm an emerging innovator with a mission to disrupt the biomedical industry using cloud, AI, and ML technologies and build products and services through my company, Neuralyte. My goal is to influence social change and develop accessible solutions to pressing issues the world faces using emerging technologies.

-------- 

I’m currently working on 🔭
  - Using ML 🤖 to detect genetic factors that can relate to leukemic stem cell proliferation
  - Understanding global and local sequence alignment through the BLAST and Needleman-Wunsch algorithm 💻
  - Finding sets of similar genes 🧬 between anatomically close cancers through clustering algorithms

Some of my past projects 📝
  - 🧫 Identification of Biological Pathways Causative for Breast Cancer Through Unsupervised Machine Learning - [paper](https://horizonreport23.s3.amazonaws.com/report.html), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbZjcXZJOA4&t=3s)
  - ✖️ Determining Smallest Path Size of Multiplication Transducers Without a Restricted Digit Set - [paper](http://multiplication-transducers.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/), [article](https://studentsxstudents.com/building-your-own-multiplication-transducer-1a621e79c69d)
  - Have a writing publication on Medium (15k+ page views, 400+ writers, organized TEDx) ✍🏼

Some of my past internships 🖇 
  - Ocean Genomics - a comp bio startup modernizing online RNA-seq for more cost-efficient analysis on personalized prediction
  - Mpathy Software - using NLP to make a formalized electronic health record system to allow for simpler patient documentation

I’m currently learning 🌱 : image segmentation, eQTLs, differential gene analysis, mathematics behind backpropagation
