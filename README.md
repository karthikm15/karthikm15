**karthikm15/karthikm15** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  - Using ML 🤖 to detect genetic factors that can relate to leukemic stem cell proliferation
  - Understanding global and local sequence alignment through the BLAST and Needleman-Wunsch algorithm 💻
  - Finding sets of similar genes 🧬 between anatomically close cancers through clustering algorithms

📝 Some of my past projects ...
  - Two papers in ML+bioinformatics space, and working on a third in a novel mathematics field (multiplication transducers) under Ph.D.s
  - Have a startup to influence the education+healthcare industry (beta-tested extracurricular recommendation service at local school, have disease outbreak platform that parses online news headlines and predicts future trends)
  - Have a writing publication on Medium (15k+ page views, 300+ writers, organized TEDx)
  - Interned at Ocean Genomics, a comp bio startup wishing to modernize online RNA-seq for more cost-efficient analysis on sequenced RNA and drug response prediction
  - Interned at Mpathy Software, using natural language processing to make a formalized electronic health record system to allow for simpler patient documentation
  - Built ML+bioinformatics projects (predicting personalities through facial expressions, finding genetic pathways that can lead to the formation of breast cancer, using HMMs to discover CpG islands, data visualization to find the best way to reorganize the homeless population through Twitter for Good)
